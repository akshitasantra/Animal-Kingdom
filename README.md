# Animal-Kingdom
Animal Kingdom is an educational and interactive computer science project designed to proactice object-oriented progrmaming (OOP) concepts through the creation and management of a simulated ecosystem. This project uses Java to demonstrate the principles of inheritance, polymorphism, and enscapusulation in a fun and engaging way. 

# Features
- Diverse Animal Classes: Define various animal species with unique characteristics and behaviors.
- Inheritance Hierarchy: Demonstrate class inheritance by creating a hierarchy of animal classes.
- Polymorphism: Implement polymorphic behavior where different animal types can be treated as instances of a common superclass.
- Encapsulation: Show the importance of encapsulation by managing the internal state of objects through methods.
- Interactive Simulation: Create an ecosystem where animals interact with each other and their environment.
